★ New Stage Mechanic "Port Anti-Air Defense"  
- Port Anti-Air Defense is a special stage in which you must protect the friendly port from enemy airstrikes using anti-air guns installed on the map.
- A friendly Port and enemy Surprise Attack Squadrons will be placed on the stage map. Enemy plane squadrons will move towards the Port.
- The Port has a set amount of HP. If an enemy squadron reaches the Port tile, the Port will take damage. The sortie will fail if the Port is destroyed.
- Friendly anti-air guns are installed on the map and have an attack range. Any enemy squadron entering the AA gun's range when it fires will be shot down and destroyed. AA guns have a few turns of cooldown after single use.
- Your main fleets (excluding submarine) may engage and destroy the enemy squadrons.
