There will be an update/maintenance from 14:00 to 18:00, JST (Japan Standard Time, GMT+9)

##New Content
###1. Limited Event "Maritime Escort."
Event Period: June 13th after maintenance - June 27th maintenance.

Event Update
- New Maritime Escort stages will be featured.
- Maritime Escort stages will be accessible from the home screen as an event icon.  

How to Play
- In Maritime Escort stages, you will need to repel enemy fleets, avoid sea mines, and escort the allied transport fleet to the designated node.
- Maritime Escort has 3 difficulties: Easy (Green), Normal (Yellow) and Hard (Red).
You only have 1 attempt per day, and the attempt counts the moment you start the stage.
- You will receive a small reward even if you retreat or fail the stage.
- Each time your main fleet moves, the allied transport fleet will move 1 node on the map towards the designated node.
 - When the allied transport fleet encounters an enemy fleet, it will lose 1 HP and enter the state "Under Attack."
 - While the allied transport fleet is under attack, its HP will decrease for every turn your main fleet takes until the enemy fleet attacking the transport is destroyed.
 - If the allied transport fleet hits a sea mine, it will lose 2 HP.
 - If your main fleet hits a sea mine, its total HP will decrease. However, if your main fleet contains a destroyer, no HP will be deducted, and the mine will be cleared.
- When the stage is successfully cleared, the remaining HP of the transport fleet determines the reward.
