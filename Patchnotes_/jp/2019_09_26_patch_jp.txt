Maintenance Period: September 26th 14:00 - 20:00 JST.

#New Events
##1. Limited Event "A New Crosswave"
Event Period: September 26th after maintenance - October 10th maintenance.
- "A New Crosswave" is a server-coop event in which you will fight against Suruga and the Sakura Empire Drill Fleet in a special event stage.

★ How to Play  
- Commanders can earn "Drill Points" and contribute to the event completion progress of their servers, a Drill Gauge, by clearing the event stage. 
- To successfully complete the drill, commanders must cooperate to obtain Drill Points and reduce the Drill Gauge to 0%.
When the drill has been completed, all commanders who participated will be rewarded special equipment via mailbox.

###A. About Drill Points
1. Drill Points can be earned by clearing the event stage.
2. The progress a server makes on its Drill Gauge is determined by the total number of Drill Points earned by all commanders in that server.
3. Each server's progress is calculated separately. When the Drill Gauge reaches 0%, the drill is successfully completed.
4. After the drill is completed, commanders will still be able to clear the stage and obtain Drill Points.
5. There are Drill Point accumulation rewards that can be obtained from the event banner.

###B. About the Event Stage
1. The event stage has 4 difficulties, Easy, Normal, Hard, and EX.
2. The number of Drill Points rewarded is the same for Easy, Normal, and Hard. For EX, Drill Points and rewards will change depending on the damage dealt.
3. The event stage will use its own fleet composition separate from the normal fleet comps.
4. A Mock Battle option is available for EX.
5. Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulties can be accessed and cleared whenever. In order to attempt EX, a Special Pass is required.
6. Submarines and Offnyaa can be used for the event stage. Summoning submarines will cost Fuel.
7. Entering/clearing the event stage will consume Fuel and Morale in the same way as normal sorties do. In addition, experience and clear rewards will be given and Morale will change upon stage clear.

- The time limit for the event stage is 60 seconds. Running out of time, destroying the enemy, or the flagship sinking all will be treated as stage clear.
- There will be no sinking penalty for Morale in any difficulty for the event stage.
- Entering Mock Battles does not consume Fuel, Morale, or Special Passes, nor will clearing it give any experience and rewards.


###C. About Stage Bonuses and Special Passes

1. For Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulties, each difficulty has its own daily stage bonus. Clearing with the bonus active will reward more rewards compared to without. Each bonus is active for 15 clears.
2. In the case that you enter a non-EX difficulty without stage bonus AND possess a Special Pass, 1 Special Pass will be consumed to activate the stage bonus.
3. A Special Pass is immediately consumed as you enter the EX difficulty.
4. Special Passes can be obtained from event missions.

※ Note
- If an EX difficulty attempt is prematurely terminated, the Special Pass will be consumed, and no rewards or Drill Points will be given.
- If a non-EX difficulty attempt is prematurely terminated with stage bonus active, the stage bonus for that attempt will not be used.
- Manual play is recommended for EX difficulty.
- It is recommended to sortie in consideration of the Morale, affection, and strength of your fleet.
- Depending on the user data of each server, the total number of clears to reduce the Drill Gauge to 0% required from each server will be different.
