★ How to Obtain In-game Votes  
After Commander Level 25, players will have the following two ways of obtaining votes,
- 1. Clear limited campaign missions
- 2. Defeat bosses and obtain "Support Orders"
- Support Orders can be used either on the chapter stage selection screen or the poll campaign screen to gain "Support Points."
A vote can be acquired once enough Support Points have been accumulated.

Note that all available votes will be voided after a voting stage ends.

★ What are Support Orders  
- Support Orders can be obtained from bosses in normal mode, Chapter 3 and above, and event stages.  
- There can only be one Support Order at any time. It can be only used on the chapter stage selection screen or the poll campaign screen.  
- Once a Support Order has been used, a number of chibi characters will appear, and a Manjuu will point in a certain direction. Tap all the chibis to the direction the Manjuu is pointing to complete the Support Order and obtain Support Points.
- Support Orders will differ in effect depending on the stage it was dropped from.
