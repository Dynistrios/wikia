There will be an update/maintenance from July 11th 14:00-20:00, JST.

##New Features
###1. Added weekly "Transport Raid" stage.
You will be able to manually control your fleet of submarines in the Transport Raid stage.
You may access the stage any day of the week, but you can only clear the Transport Raid twice per week.

A submarine will have different actions compared to those available for normal surface combat.
- Special Barrage: a barrage only usable by submarines; each submarine can only fire the barrage once.
- Submerge/Surface: make your submarine submerge or surface.
- Character Switch: switch to another submarine in your fleet; default character is the flagship submarine.
- Torpedo Strike: launch a torpedo; the number of torpedoes is limited.

There are various clear conditions for the weekly stage, such as reaching the end of the stage and number of enemies destroyed.
Clearing rewards include submarine and anti-submarine warfare equipment.
These rewards will depend on the rank you achieved in the stage.

Weekly Stage Scoring  
- Clearing stage: 100 Pts  
- Destroy 1 transport: +10 Pts  
- Sink 1 friendly submarine: -15 Pts  

Rankings
- S Rank: >120 Pts
- A Rank: >100 Pts
- B Rank: >70 Pts

※ The number of torpedoes each submarine carries can be increased by equipping submarine torpedoes and auxiliary torpedo equipment.  
※ Submarine skills except for barrages are disabled in the weekly stage. Barrages can be fired by using the Special Barrage action.  
※ Damage dealt by the special barrage is increased in the weekly stage.

Make sure to use your limited ammunition wisely to clear the stage and maximize your rewards.

###2. Added ability to change submarine hunting range position.
You will be able to manually change your submarine fleet's hunting range position after the update.

- By tapping the Move Hunting Range button on the right side of the stage map, you can choose a new square for your submarine fleet to move to.  
- Not only will your submarine fleet move to the new square, that square will also become the new center for the hunting range.  
- Changing the hunting range position will cost Fuel. Fuel cost depends on the distance traveled and the number of submarines in the fleet.  

※ Manually moving your submarines does not consume a movement turn from your main fleet (free action). Submarine fleet movement speed does not affect how far you can manually move your fleet.
